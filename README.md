Code Refactoring and Bug Fixing

Scenario:
A team of enthusiastic data scientists embarked on a mission to develop a Note Taking Application using Python, Flask, and HTML. However, their lack of experience in backend development has led to challenges in making the application fully functional. Recognizing your proficiency in backend development, you have been tasked with fixing the broken code and ensuring the application works seamlessly.

Task:
Refactor the existing codebase and ensure the proper functioning of the Note Taking Application. Document all identified bugs during the debugging process. Remember, the task is not about recreating the app from scratch. Your goal is to fix the already existing codebase and make the application work as intended.

More Details:
The application's home route contains a text field and a button. Users can add a note, and all the notes should be displayed as an unordered list below the text field on the same page.

Submission Requirements:
Please submit a ZIP file containing the following:
1. Working code after refactoring and bug fixing.
2. A report detailing all identified bugs along with the approach used to resolve each bug.

We encourage you to collaborate with your peers and utilize online resources to complete this task successfully. Your submission will be evaluated based on the quality of the code, effectiveness of bug fixes, and clarity of documentation.
